    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re looking for a graphic designer at the moment. When we couldn&rsquo;t get any suitable recommendations from friends we turned to the freelance boards.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>When the job was up and posted we expected to get a few copy and pasted responses. <strong>But in fact about 90% of the proposals we received made no effort to address the brief at all.</strong> Unbelievably, the majority didn&rsquo;t include a message of any kind, they just sent a link to a portfolio.</p>

<p>We haven&rsquo;t received a single one that addressed every point.</p>

<p>The brief was to redesign our app and make it iOS 7 ready. Here&rsquo;s what we said we wanted:</p>

<ul>
<li>Someone who loves their work and takes great pride in it</li>
<li>A portfolio full of great iOS app designs, iOS icon designs and iOS app marketing material (the initial work is for the UI design, but we&rsquo;ll need the other stuff eventually)</li>
<li>Links to live apps in the App Store</li>
<li>A great communicator who can help us get the most out of the experience</li>
</ul>


<p>Straight away, the designers who just fired us a link failed the &lsquo;great communicator&rsquo; test. Here&rsquo;s what I think the rest could have done better.</p>

<h2>why do you want this job?</h2>

<p>This is key. As someone building a product I&rsquo;m 100% into it. I want to hear that the applicant <em>wants</em> to be part of this.</p>

<p>If you went for a real life job interview the first question you&rsquo;d be asked is: &ldquo;Why do you want to work for this company?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Applying for freelance work is pretty much like a job interview, right? Only without the pressure of a face to face meeting.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you can&rsquo;t think of a reason you want the work then save yourself and the hirer some time and don&rsquo;t apply for the job.</p></blockquote>

<p>Think about it from my perspective: This project is my life, why would I hire someone who can&rsquo;t raise enough enthusiasm to tell me why they want to work on it too?</p>

<p>If you do want the work, put the time into writing something that convinces me of this.</p>

<h2>relevant experience</h2>

<p>The next thing you&rsquo;d get asked in a job interview is &ldquo;why do you think you are suitable for this role?&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>If you don&rsquo;t have the experience required, don&rsquo;t apply for the job</p></blockquote>

<p>If you have similar experience, but not quite what is asked for AND you really want the job then go into detail about why you think it&rsquo;s relevant and put extra emphasis into the &lsquo;why&rsquo; part. Sell it to me.</p>

<h2>how to showcase your work</h2>

<p>If you can demonstrate you want to the work and have the required experience, you&rsquo;re probably in the top 50% of candidates so far.</p>

<p>But your portfolio has be convincing. This is your ace in the hole, the one opportunity you have to demonstrate the kind of skills and innovation we&rsquo;re looking for. I was surprised to find that even the few candidates who came across well in other areas didn&rsquo;t take the time to get this right:</p>

<h3>1. don&rsquo;t send a portfolio</h3>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. I&rsquo;m getting more than a hundred responses to my job post, I don&rsquo;t want to have to trawl through your 50Mb PDF file trying to identify the examples that are relevant to me.</p>

<blockquote><p>I want to see two or three (or even one) highly relevant piece of work</p></blockquote>

<p>So don&rsquo;t send your whole portfolio, pick out the most relevant things and send those. Include an explanation about why you think those items are relevant. If you can demonstrate that you understand what the hirer wants, you&rsquo;ll be able to create a much better connection with them.</p>

<h3>2. do send graphics that present your work clearly</h3>

<p>This was another surprising one. I&rsquo;m looking for an iPhone app designer, right? So I want to  see iPhone screens. I want to see the detail of the UI you&rsquo;ve slaved over and crafted. I don&rsquo;t want to see something rendered in 3D or something so over-designed that it obscures your work.</p>

<p><img src="https://ws.elance.com/file/TrainSmart_MockUp.png?crypted=Y3R4JTNEcG9ydGZvbGlvJTI2ZmlkJTNEODA5NDE2MzclMjZyaWQlM0QtMSUyNnBpZCUzRDQ1MzQ2OTM" title="iPhone Screens" alt="iPhone Screenshots in a 3d fan" /></p>

<p>The screens here look really well designed. At least the first one does… if I tilt my head a bit. The others look like they might be well designed, but it&rsquo;s hard to be sure because they&rsquo;re hidden.</p>

<blockquote><p>Don&rsquo;t use nice effects at the expense of making it easy to view your work</p></blockquote>

<h3>3. do send real world examples</h3>

<p>Even better than properly presented graphics is a  live product. In fact, if you have links to a product in the App Store, you don&rsquo;t even need to send graphics.</p>

<blockquote><p>Only 2% of applications sent us links to apps in the store</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s even though we specified that we wanted to see links in the brief. For the rest, we had to dig around ourselves to check if their designs had indeed made it into the store. It&rsquo;s a lame excuse to say you can&rsquo;t provide a link because you were &lsquo;just&rsquo; the designer &ndash; if we could find them (eventually), then so could you.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you can send promo codes too it shows a level of proof and confidence that will be impossible to ignore</p></blockquote>

<p>Don&rsquo;t have promo codes for your previous work? Ask the developer/hirer for a few, even offer to buy them of them. Trust me, sending promo codes will make you look great.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This is very useful and makes it easy to measure everything I need in my weight loss regime. Very good motivator- better than the scale!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love this app. It is a great tool to track weight loss!!!&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>People obviously enjoy using our app, but I wish more people would go ahead and say so.</p>

<p>All we&rsquo;d done to encourage reviews is add <a href="https://github.com/LukeDurrant/Ask4AppReviews">Ask4AppReviews</a> to the code and let it go. This did get us reviews, but not as many as we would like (or frankly think that we deserve).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>When we thought about how <em>we</em> used our app, we realised that we always take our measurements first thing in the morning. This is before work time and personally <strong>I would NEVER review an app while I&rsquo;m rushing to get ready for work</strong>. But I would later in the day if I was just browsing my measurements.</p>

<p><strong>I&rsquo;d be even more likely to leave a review on a Saturday or a Sunday.</strong></p>

<p>As we don&rsquo;t have any analytics on this we couldn&rsquo;t check the time of day theory, but we checked the week day part. <strong>It turns out that although we have a lot less users on the weekend, half our reviews have come on those two days.</strong></p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>So with the above in mind we set the following goals:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be able to test different times of day for prompting</li>
<li>Be able to test different messages &ndash; fine tuning this has got to make a difference</li>
<li>Both of the above should be configurable without a new release through the app store</li>
<li>Get analytics on all stages of the <a href="https://github.com/LukeDurrant/Ask4AppReviews">Ask4AppReviews</a> process, when we ask, when users start sending an email, when they say no or ask later, everything</li>
</ol>


<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>I figured I needed to make the following changes to <a href="https://github.com/LukeDurrant/Ask4AppReviews">Ask4AppReviews</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/general/conceptual/CocoaEncyclopedia/DelegatesandDataSources/DelegatesandDataSources.html">delegate</a> so you can capture analytics events</li>
<li>Make all of the hard coded values in <a href="https://github.com/LukeDurrant/Ask4AppReviews">Ask4AppReviews</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9544370/objective-c-property-and-synthesize-logic">@properties</a> so we could configure them at run time for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B</a> testing</li>
<li>Add a way of specifying a time of day to show the prompt. Also configurable at runtime</li>
</ol>


<p>I <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">forked</a> <a href="https://github.com/LukeDurrant/Ask4AppReviews">Ask4AppReviews</a> and have updated it with these changes here: <a href="https://github.com/lewisalexander/Ask4AppReviewsABOptimised">Ask4AppReviewsABOptimised</a></p>

<p>The next thing is to setup <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B Testing</a> on a server. <a href="https://github.com/KeepSafe/Switchboard">SwitchBoard</a> seemed to be the best option for that and I wrote two experiments, one for each of the first two goals above. For now though only the times are actually in a split test. Although the messages are returned from a test, every user sees the same message. When you&rsquo;re doing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B Testing</a> you should only be testing one variable at a time, especially when working with relatively small datasets.</p>

<p>For the time to prompt we&rsquo;ve setup three groups:
&ndash; Weekday mornings
&ndash; Weekday afternoons
&ndash; Weekends all day</p>

<h2>Some code</h2>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how I initialise <a href="https://github.com/lewisalexander/Ask4AppReviewsABOptimised">Ask4AppReviewsABOptimised</a>:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) setupAskForReviews
{
    [Ask4AppReviews appLaunched:NO viewController: self.window.rootViewController];
    Ask4AppReviews *ask4AppReviews = [Ask4AppReviews sharedInstance];
        AskForAppReviewsDelegate *reviewsDelegate = [[AskForAppReviewsDelegate alloc] init];

    if([Switchboard isInExperiment:@"timeForReview"]) {
        NSLog(@"isInExperiment time for review");
        if([Switchboard hasExperimentValues:@"timeForReview"]) {
            ask4AppReviews.eventsUntilPrompt = 1;
            NSLog(@"has switchboard values");

            NSDictionary *values = [Switchboard getExperimentValueFromJSON:@"timeForReview"];

            NSString *description = [values objectForKey:@"description"];
            NSNumber *startHour = [values objectForKey:@"startHour"];
            NSNumber *endHour = [values objectForKey:@"endHour"];

            ask4AppReviews.timeRange = [[Ask4AppReviewsTimeRange alloc]
                                        initWithDaysOfWeek:[values objectForKey:@"days"]
                                        startHour:startHour.integerValue
                                        endHour:endHour.integerValue
                                        description:[values objectForKey:@"description"]];

            reviewsDelegate.testName = description;

            NSLog(@"Using AB Prompt Test set: %@", [values objectForKey:@"description"]);
        }
    }

    if ([Switchboard hasExperimentValues:@"reviewMessages"]) {
        NSDictionary *values = [Switchboard getExperimentValueFromJSON:@"reviewMessages"];

        if (values) {
            NSArray *keys = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:@"doYouLikeAppTitle",
                             @"doYouLikeAppBody",
                             @"likeItButton",
                             @"dontLikeItButton",
                             @"askLaterButton",

                             @"askForReviewBody",
                             @"askForReviewTitle",
                             @"reviewButton",
                             @"noButton",
                             @"emailSubject",
                             @"emailBody",

                             @"daysUntilPrompt",
                             @"usesUntilPrompt",
                             @"eventsUntilPrompt",
                             @"daysBeforeReminding", nil];

            for (NSString *key in keys) {
                if ([values objectForKey:key]) {
                    [ask4AppReviews setValue:[values objectForKey:key] forKey:key];
                }
            }

            reviewsDelegate.testName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@-%@", reviewsDelegate.testName, [values objectForKey: @"description"]];

            NSLog(@"review message test set: %@", reviewsDelegate.testName);
        }
    }

    ask4AppReviews.delegate = reviewsDelegate;

#ifdef DEBUG
//    ask4AppReviews.eventsUntilPrompt = 1;
//    ask4AppReviews.daysUntilPrompt = 0;
//    ask4AppReviews.usesUntilPrompt = 0;
//    ask4AppReviews.daysBeforeReminding = 0;
//    ask4AppReviews.timeRange = nil;
#endif
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the implementation of the delegate:</p>

<pre><code>@implementation AskForAppReviewsDelegate

-(void)ask4ReviewsDidAskQuestion:(Ask4AppReviews *)ask4AppReviews {
    [self trackEventWithAction:@"Asked Question" andTimeRange:ask4AppReviews.timeRange];
}

    [self trackEventWithAction:@"Remind from First Question" andTimeRange:ask4AppReviews.timeRange];
}
-(void)ask4ReviewsDidOpenEmailCompose:(Ask4AppReviews *)ask4AppReviews{
    [self trackEventWithAction:@"Compose Email" andTimeRange:ask4AppReviews.timeRange];
}
-(void)ask4ReviewsDidSendEmail:(Ask4AppReviews *)ask4AppReviews{
    [self trackEventWithAction:@"Send Email" andTimeRange:ask4AppReviews.timeRange];
}
-(void)ask4ReviewsDidNotSendEmail:(Ask4AppReviews *)ask4AppReviews{
    [self trackEventWithAction:@"Cancel Email" andTimeRange:ask4AppReviews.timeRange];
}

-(void)ask4ReviewsDidAskForReview:(Ask4AppReviews *)ask4AppReviews{
    [self trackEventWithAction:@"Asked for Review" andTimeRange:ask4AppReviews.timeRange];
}
-(void)ask4ReviewsDidOptToReview:(Ask4AppReviews *)ask4AppReviews{
    [self trackEventWithAction:@"Review Given" andTimeRange:ask4AppReviews.timeRange];
}
-(void)ask4ReviewsDidDeclineToReview:(Ask4AppReviews *)ask4AppReviews{
    [self trackEventWithAction:@"Declined to Review" andTimeRange:ask4AppReviews.timeRange];
}
-(void)ask4ReviewsDidOptToRemindLaterFromPromptToReview:(Ask4AppReviews *)ask4AppReviews{
    [self trackEventWithAction:@"Remind from Review Question" andTimeRange:ask4AppReviews.timeRange];
}

-(void) trackEventWithAction:(NSString*) action andTimeRange:(Ask4AppReviewsTimeRange*)timeRange
{
    NSString *val = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@-%@", self.testName, action];
    [[[GAI sharedInstance] defaultTracker] trackEventWithCategory:@"reviews" withAction:val withLabel:val withValue:nil];
}
@end
</code></pre>

<p>And the timeForReview experiment:</p>

<pre><code>function timeForReview() {

    if(empty($this-&gt;manager-&gt;uuid))
        return $this-&gt;manager-&gt;inactiveExperimentReturnArray();

    if($this-&gt;manager-&gt;isInBucket(0, 100)) {

        //return values
        $values = array();

        if($this-&gt;manager-&gt;isInBucket(0, 33)){

            $values['startHour'] = 0;
      $values['endHour'] = 12;
      $values['days'] = array(2,3,4,5,6);
      $values['description'] = 'weekday-mornings'; 

            return $this-&gt;manager-&gt;activeExperimentReturnArray($values);

        } else if($this-&gt;manager-&gt;isInBucket(33, 66)) {

      $values['startHour'] = 12;
      $values['endHour'] = 24;
      $values['days'] = array(2,3,4,5,6);
      $values['description'] = 'weekday-afternoon';

      return $this-&gt;manager-&gt;activeExperimentReturnArray($values);

    } else {

            $values['startHour'] = 0;
      $values['endHour'] = 24;
      $values['days'] = array(1,7);
      $values['description'] = 'weekday-afternoon';

            return $this-&gt;manager-&gt;activeExperimentReturnArray($values);
        }       
    }
    //user is not in experiment as default
    return $this-&gt;manager-&gt;inactiveExperimentReturnArray();
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Sources of Email</h2>

<p>One final thing. There&rsquo;s a few places our users can contact us from:</p>

<ol>
<li>From <a href="https://github.com/lewisalexander/Ask4AppReviewsABOptimised">Ask4AppReviewsABOptimised</a></li>
<li>From the About Screen in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/body-trackit-weight-measurements/id579976234?mt=8">app</a></li>
<li>From our <a href="http://www.bodytrack.it">website</a></li>
</ol>


<p>We setup a different address for each one. This won&rsquo;t help with reviews, but it will give us some extra info about how people are contacting us and whether they&rsquo;re doing so because we ask them to or because they feel compelled.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve submitted these changes to Apple and I&rsquo;m really excited to see the difference it will make. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll think of other ways to increase our review rate, and if we do I&rsquo;ll share them here.</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s other stuff we could optimise on, or that you&rsquo;ve had success with please be in touch!!!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We sat down in a trendy art cafe in Chiang Mai. We wanted to work out what to do next with the app. We had a few unfinished features and a few unanswered questions. In short we needed some direction.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We started writing on cards all the things we wanted to do in all areas of the app, features, marketing, everything. As we got them down it became clear that there was a kind of hierarchy of goals. And we sorted the cards into the appropriate category.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the hierarchy that we saw:</p>

<p><img src="http://lewisalexander.github.io/user-images/hierachy.png" alt="Make more profit from More Downloads from More Reviews from More Engaged Users
" /></p>

<p>Although they all feed up, it&rsquo;s possible to address things at the higher levels specifically. For example, getting more reviews could come from thinking more carefully about how and when we ask for reviews. And more downloads could come from improved screenshots or app store wording.</p>

<p>This was kind of a revelation for me. As a developer it&rsquo;s so easy to get tied into the ground level view where you want to add features. The reviews thing in particular, we have a bit of code that prompts the user after a number of times of using the app and we thought about the wording and how many uses was ok before asking. But we didn&rsquo;t think much beyond that. Might things like time of day make a difference?  The more we thought about it the more we thought it would.</p>

<p>We also realised there was a lot more analytics we could be collecting to help us understand our customers better and make more informed decisions about which features to include.</p>

<p>So we&rsquo;ve decided to park the new features and focus purely on the science of getting more review and more downloads for a little bit. As well as collecting more data to help us decide how to approach increasing engagement.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Refine which screens on the app will ask a user for a review. Never ask just when the app opens</li>
<li>Add reporting to know how many times we ask for a review and how many times people say yes, no and later</li>
<li>A/B test the time of day to ask for a review. I have a theory that for our app asking in the afternoon will give better results than in the morning, but I want to test that</li>
<li>Add events for data collection and add goals in analytics</li>
<li>Collect data about which model our users are using. For whatever reason analytics doesn&rsquo;t gather this by default. This is particularly important as iOS 7 approaches as some devices will not be able to upgrade</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It all started with trying to fit into my wedding suit &ndash; as all good app development stories do. A healthy intake of beers and burgers had given me a few too many extra inches around the belly and those inches needed to come off. Diets aren&rsquo;t really my thing but Tim Ferriss&#8217; Four Hour Body appealed to the geek in me because it&rsquo;s closer to science than most. He&rsquo;s dug into the chemistry, there&rsquo;s a definite &lsquo;right and wrong&rsquo; way of doing it (the fewer decisions required, the better), and he measures everything &ndash; in spreadsheets, no less. If ever there was a man-friendly diet, this is it.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>One of 4HB&rsquo;s commandments is that you consistently measure your arms, hips, waist and legs in order to calculate your Total Body Measurements, and then track this figure along with your body fat percentage. But the spreadsheet just didn&rsquo;t cut it.</p>

<p>I’d been looking to get into iPhone development for a while so I decided to roll my own body measurements tracking app as a learning project. As it was just for me it didn’t need to be too polished, but being a big fan of Apple products I also wanted to include the native controls and gestures to make it feel as much like a proper iPhone app as possible.</p>

<p>The first version was pretty basic, but way better than a spreadsheet. After using it for a while it occurred to me that other 4HBers might also want an easier way of tracking their measurements. So, without polishing or refining, I put it on the App Store to see what happened. And people downloaded it. Not in their thousands, but enough to make me think there was a market I could tap into to make some money. So there it was: No monetization strategy, no marketing plan, no slick design or well thought out UI. My first app was quick and dirty, but it&rsquo;s evolved into something I&rsquo;m really proud of. And it helped me get into that wedding suit.</p>
