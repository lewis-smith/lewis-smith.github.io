    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For some reason we thought that finding a graphic designer would be easyâ€¦</p>

<p>We&rsquo;d just post on elance, get loads of replies from talented, experienced and readily available people and then pick one and get some great screens designed.</p>

<h2>what we found</h2>

<p>As I mentioned in my <a href="/blog/2013/08/07/how-to-apply-for-graphic-design-work/">last post</a> our experience was a little different and we abandoned elance after a frustrating week.</p>

<p>We then moved onto <a href="www.behance.net">behance</a> and found we had only a slightly better response. We approached one guy whose work we liked, but on speaking with him he didn&rsquo;t feel like a good fit. We had lots of applicants but a lot didn&rsquo;t read the brief or provide what we&rsquo;d asked for.</p>

<p>I then tried looking around on Google. There&rsquo;s obviously plenty of people to sift through &ndash; far too many really -and I went through the first 5 pages of results and contacted a few who I liked. Some weren&rsquo;t available, some said our budget wasn&rsquo;t high enough. The rest just couldn&rsquo;t show us what we wanted to see.</p>

<p>Next I tried <a href="www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a>. LinkedIn is  less cut out for this than I would have expected. Surprisingly few people had their actual work shown online. I found a couple of promising people based solely on their CVs (working with Google, Adobe, Apple, etc) and in the end I did find one person who was our runner up choice.</p>

<p>Finally we got an <a href="Greg">applicant</a> we liked on <a href="www.behance.net">behance</a> and after speaking to him on Skype and having a long email conversation with him we&rsquo;ve decided to go ahead with him. We&rsquo;re excited to see how it works out. The phrase <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">&ldquo;how big could this company get if the founders did the right things?&rdquo;</a> is always in my head when we&rsquo;re making decisions like this. I&rsquo;ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<h2>what we learned</h2>

<p><strong>My biggest take away from this is that we should have allowed a lot more time.</strong> Feeling rushed stressed us out and made making a confident decision a lot harder.</p>

<p>Second, right after we&rsquo;d settled on someone we learned about <a href="www.ooomf.com">ooomf</a>. I&rsquo;d use this next time as it seems to take care of a lot of the hard work for you. I expect the prices would be very high though. (I&rsquo;d love to hear experiences from either hirers or freelancers on this site).</p>

<p>Third, I wouldn&rsquo;t use elance again, not for graphic design anyway. I would spend more time combing through <a href="www.behance.net">behance</a> and <a href="http://dribbble.com">dribble</a> looking for people to approach rather than posting a listing and waiting for reactions.</p>

<p>Finally, although at the time I thought we were clear about our requirements I think with hindsight we could have included more detail up front. More importantly I think we could have been more blunt about ignoring people who didn&rsquo;t send the minimum spec. I&rsquo;d also set a test like &lsquo;include this phrase at the top of your bid&rsquo; to show that candidates have read all the way through the brief.</p>

<p>In short, we&rsquo;ve learned a lot over the past few weeks and we know what we&rsquo;d do differently should we need to hire another designer. But, honestly, I really hope we don&rsquo;t need to go through that process again any time soon.</p>
